            <li>Water for steaming</li>
            <li>Parchment paper or lettuce leaves (to line the steamer)</li>
    </ul>

   <h4>Instructions:</h4> 
   <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
        <ul>

        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Gradually add warm water, kneading until you get a soft, smooth dough. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Prepare the Filling:</li>       
            <ul>
        <li>Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the minced ginger and garlic, sauté for a minute.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped vegetables and cook for 5-7 minutes until they are tender. Stir in soy sauce, and season with salt and pepper. Allow the mixture to cool.</li>
    </ul>
        <li>Assemble the Momos:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Divide the dough into small balls. On a floured surface, roll each ball into a thin circle (about 3-4 inches in diameter).</li>
        <li>Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each circle. Fold the dough around the filling, pinching the edges to seal. You can shape the momos into pleats or simply fold them in half and pinch the edges together.</li>
    </ul>
       <li> Steam the Momos:</li>
<ul>
<li>Line a steamer basket with parchment paper or lettuce leaves to prevent sticking.</li>
<li>Arrange the momos in the steamer, leaving some space between them.</li>
<li>Steam over boiling water for about 15-20 minutes, or until the dough is cooked through and the filling is hot.</li>
</ul>
<li>Serve:</li>
<ul>
<li>Serve the momos hot with a dipping sauce, such as spicy tomato chutney or soy sauce.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
