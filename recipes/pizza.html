    </ul>
    </ul>
     <h5>Instructions</h5>
     <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
        <ul>
           <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, until foamy.</li> 
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Create a well in the center, and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until combined, then knead on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a bowl, mix together the tomato sauce, tomato paste, oregano, basil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Adjust seasoning to taste.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Assemble the Pizza:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
            <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it in half if making two pizzas. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet or a preheated pizza stone.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and your favorite toppings.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bake:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, slice, and enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
